## üí° Key Concepts (Week-1 Highlights)

- **Timing Libraries**: PVT variations ensure reliable operation; guide synthesis & timing analysis.  
- **Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis**: Hierarchical ‚Üí modular, reusable; Flat ‚Üí optimized for speed/area.  
- **Flip-Flop Coding Styles**: Use synchronous resets by default; async resets for exceptional cases.  
- **Combinational Optimization**: Logic squeezing, constant propagation, Boolean simplification (K-map, Quine-McCluskey).  
- **Sequential Optimization**: Sequential constant propagation, state optimization, cloning, retiming.  
- **GLS & SSM**: Gate-level simulation validates netlist functionality; avoid synthesis-simulation mismatches with synthesizable RTL.  
- **Verilog Constructs**: Correct use of if-else, case, for loops, generate blocks; avoid inferred latches.  
- **RCA (Ripple Carry Adder)**: Full adders chained; carry ripples through stages.
